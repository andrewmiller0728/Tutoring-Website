                <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to current circumstances, students across the United States have not been able to attend in-person classes. Because of this, many students are not able to receive the academic assistance provided through in-person education. I believe students deserve the one-on-one help they would receive through their normal schooling. Andrew's Tutoring Services are available in a one-on-one format, online or in-person.

                <h3>My Education</h3>
                <p>
                    A proud alumnus of <a class="inlinenav" href="https://henricoschools.us/">Henrico County Public Schools</a>, I attended <a class="inlinenav" href="https://echolake.henricoschools.us/">Echo Lake Elementary School</a>, <a class="inlinenav" href="https://hungarycreek.henricoschools.us/">Hungary Creek Middle School</a>, and <a class="inlinenav" href="https://godwin.henricoschools.us/">Mills E. Godwin High School</a>'s Specialty Center for Science, Math, and Technology. I am now pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. As the high school would suggest, my favorite subjects are math and science.

                <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    A love of technology can be found in everything I do. From video games to RC cars and planes, I enjoy creating and playing with the world around me. In high school, I was a member of <a class="inlinenav" href="https://www.team540.com/">TALON 540</a>, Godwin's <a class="inlinenav" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc"> <span class="italics">FIRST</span> Robotics Competition</a> team. I found my love of engineering on the team and it has led me to many fun projects.
